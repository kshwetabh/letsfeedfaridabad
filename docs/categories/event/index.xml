Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>

      <description>Pichkari for kids Thanks team for joining today, it was small school near the old Faridabad chowk. School staff &amp;amp; kids needed a lot of support we felt. Kids were happy to see somebody coming and talking to them. Kids enjoyed frooti, dancing, singing and poem recitation. We gave them pichkari &amp;amp; they promised that they will save it till holi 😀. Thanks team for joining today, Vikas, Chander, Jyoti, Sandeep &amp;amp; my son Hitansh.</description>

## Pichkari for kids
Thanks team for joining today, it was small school near the old Faridabad chowk. School staff & kids needed a lot of support we felt. Kids were happy to see somebody coming and talking to them. Kids enjoyed frooti, dancing, singing and poem recitation. We gave them pichkari & they promised that they will save it till holi 😀. Thanks team for joining today, Vikas, Chander, Jyoti, Sandeep & my son Hitansh. Great time spend. 👍
